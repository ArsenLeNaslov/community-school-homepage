# Space Community School Homepage

A galaxy-themed Homepage built with HTML and CSS, following the instruction provided on MDN's "Challenge: Typesetting a community school homepage" exercise: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Fancy_letterheaded_paper](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Text_styling/Typesetting_a_homepage)

I used just one custom font instead of the many suggested in the original exercise.
