# Space Community School Homepage

A galaxy-themed Homepage built with HTML and CSS, following the instruction provided on MDN's Challenge: [Typesetting a community school homepage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Text_styling/Typesetting_a_homepage) exercise.

In this exercise, I used just [ZenDots](https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/zen-dots) custom font instead of the many suggested in the original exercise. 

The font is free to use under the [Open Font License](https://openfontlicense.org/)
